############
Requirements
############

Butterfly Backup is a *simple* wrapper of rsync written in python; this means the first requirements is python3.3 or higher.
The other requirement is a openssh and rsync (version 2.5 or higher).
Ok, let's go!

Installation
------------

Install Butterfly Backup is very simple; run this:

.. code-block:: bash

   arthur@heartofgold$ git clone https://github.com/MatteoGuadrini/Butterfly-Backup.git
   arthur@heartofgold$ cd Butterfly-Backup
   arthur@heartofgold$ sudo python3 setup.py
   arthur@heartofgold$ bb --help
   arthur@heartofgold$ man bb

The upgrade is also simple; type the same commands.

.. _core:

############
Core concept
############

Butterfly Backup it is a server to client tool. It must be installed on a server (for example a workstation PC),
from where it will contact the clients on which it will perform the backup. Also for the restore the concept is the same;
the server pushes files into the client.

Backups are organized according to precise cataloguing; this is an example:

.. code-block:: bash

   arthur@heartofgold$ tree destination/of/backup
   .
   ├── destination
   │   ├── hostname or ip of the PC under backup
   │   │   ├── timestamp folder
   │   │   │   ├── backup folders
   │   │   │   ├── backup.log
   │   │   │   └── restore.log
   │   │   ├─── general.log
   │   │   └─── symlink of last backup
   │
   ├── export.log
   ├── backup.list
   └── .catalog.cfg

This is how the operating system sees the backups on the file system:

* **destination**: it is the destination of all backup of all machine under Butterfly Backup system; this is root.
* **hostname or ip of the PC under backup**: it is the root of every machine under backup; contains all the backups.
* **timestamp folder**: this is a single backup folder; contains all the data that have been backed up.
* **backup.log**: if enabled, it is the log generated by rsync for backup operation.
* **restore.log**: if enabled, it is the log generated by rsync for restore operation.
* **general.log**: if enabled, it is the general log of the machine; contains all the info, warnings and errors generated during the backup.
* **symlink of last backup**: this is a symbolic link of the last backup made. Isn't supported if you use an MS-DOS file system.
* **backup.list**: if enabled, it is the log generated by list operation.
* **export.log**: if enabled, it is the log generated by export operation.
* **.catalog.cfg**: is the log that contains the catalog of all backups. The file is the reference of Butterfly Backup to perform future backups.

.. important::
   Be careful to not delete *.catalog.cfg* file.

Butterfly Backup has, in its core, six main operations:

.. code-block:: bash

   arthur@heartofgold$ bb --help
   usage: bb [-h] [--verbose] [--log] [--dry-run] [--version]
             {config,backup,restore,archive,list,export} ...

   Butterfly Backup

   optional arguments:
     -h, --help            show this help message and exit
     --verbose, -v         Enable verbosity
     --log, -l             Create a log
     --dry-run, -N         Dry run mode
     --version, -V         Print version

   action:
     Valid action

     {config,backup,restore,archive,list,export}
                           Available actions
       config              Configuration options
       backup              Backup options
       restore             Restore options
       archive             Archive options
       list                List options
       export              Export options

Valid action

* **config**: operations involving OpenSSH and its configurations (not mandatory).
* **backup**: transactions that call rsync, in a single process or across multiple processes in case of a list.
* **restore**: transactions that call rsync for pushing files to a client.
* **archive**: transaction that zip old backups and move them to a new destination.
* **list**: query the catalog.
* **export**: export a single backup to other path.

It also has three flags that can be very useful, especially in case of error.

        -h, --help            show help message and exit
        --verbose, -v         Enable verbosity
        --log, -l             Create a log
        --dry-run, -N         Dry run mode, test your command
        --version, -V         Print version...and more


.. _config:

######
Config
######

Configuration mode is very simple; If you're already familiar with the exchange keys and OpenSSH, you probably won't need it.
If you don't want to discuss the merits of exchange keys and start, then go ahead. First, you must create a configuration (rsa keys).
Let's see how to go about looking at the help:

.. code-block:: bash

   arthur@heartofgold$ bb config --help
   usage: bb config [-h] [--verbose] [--log] [--dry-run]
                    [--new | --remove | --init INIT | --delete-host CATALOG HOST | --clean CATALOG]
                    [--deploy DEPLOY_HOST] [--user DEPLOY_USER]

   optional arguments:
     -h, --help            show this help message and exit
     --verbose, -v         Enable verbosity
     --log, -l             Create a log
     --dry-run, -N         Dry run mode

   Init configuration:
     --new, -n             Generate new configuration
     --remove, -r          Remove exist configuration
     --init INIT, -i INIT  Reset catalog file. Specify path of backup folder.
     --delete-host CATALOG HOST, -D CATALOG HOST
                           Delete all entry for a single HOST in catalog.
     --clean CATALOG, -c CATALOG
                           Cleans the catalog if it is corrupt, setting default
                           values.

   Deploy configuration:
     --deploy DEPLOY_HOST, -d DEPLOY_HOST
                           Deploy configuration to client: hostname or ip address
     --user DEPLOY_USER, -u DEPLOY_USER
                           User of the remote machine


Two macro-options are available:

* **Init configuration**: Generate new or remove configuration.
     --new, -n             Generate new configuration.
     --remove, -r          Remove exist configuration.
     --init, -i            Reset catalog file. Specify path of backup folder.
     --delete-host, -D     Delete all entry for a single HOST in catalog.
     --clean, -c           Cleans the catalog if it is corrupt, setting default values.

* **Deploy configuration**: Deploy configuration to client: hostname or ip address.
     --deploy, -d          Deploy configuration to client: hostname or ip address.
     --user, -u            User of the remote machine.

At this point, we create the configuration:

.. code-block:: bash

   arthur@heartofgold$ bb config --new
   WARNING: Private key ~/.ssh/id_rsa exists
   If you want to use the existing key, run "bb config --deploy name_of_machine", otherwise to remove it, run "bb config --remove"

In this case, the RSA key already exists. Now try delete and create a new keys:

.. code-block:: bash

   arthur@heartofgold$ bb config --remove
   Are you sure to remove existing rsa keys? To continue [Y/N]? y
   SUCCESS: Removed configuration successfully!
   arthur@heartofgold$ bb config --new
   SUCCESS: New configuration successfully created!

Once you have created the configuration, keys should be installed (copied) on the hosts you
want to backup.

::

   arthur@heartofgold$ bb config --deploy host1
   Copying configuration to host1; write the password:
   /usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: Source of key(s) to be installed: "/home/arthur/.ssh/id_rsa.pub"
   /usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: attempting to log in with the new key(s), to filter out any that are already installed
   /usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: 1 key(s) remain to be installed -- if you are prompted now it is to install the new keys
   arthur@host1's password:

   Number of key(s) added: 1

   Now try logging into the machine, with:   "ssh 'arthur@host1'"
   and check to make sure that only the key(s) you wanted were added.

   SUCCESS: Configuration copied successfully on host1!

This command will try to copy the configuration with the current user.
If you want to use a different user (e.g.: root), run this:

::

   arthur@heartofgold$ bb config --deploy host1 --user root
   Copying configuration to host1; write the password:
   /usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: Source of key(s) to be installed: "/home/arthur/.ssh/id_rsa.pub"
   /usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: attempting to log in with the new key(s), to filter out any that are already installed
   /usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: 1 key(s) remain to be installed -- if you are prompted now it is to install the new keys
   root@host1's password:

   Number of key(s) added: 1

   Now try logging into the machine, with:   "ssh 'root@host1'"
   and check to make sure that only the key(s) you wanted were added.

   SUCCESS: Configuration copied successfully on host1!

Cygwin on Windows
-----------------

In order to run Butterfly Backup on Windows hosts, you need to install cygwin.
Download https://cygwin.com/ cygwin and follow this instructions to install the necessary packages.

.. code-block:: winbatch

   :: INSTALL SOFTWARE
   :: Automates cygwin installation

   SETLOCAL

   :: Change to the directory of the executing batch file
   CD %~dp0

   :: Configure our paths
   SET SITE=http://mirrors.kernel.org/sourceware/cygwin/
   SET LOCALDIR=%LOCALAPPDATA%/cygwin
   SET ROOTDIR=C:/cygwin

   :: These are the packages we will install (in addition to the default packages)
   SET PACKAGES=mintty,wget,ctags,diffutils,openssh,rsync,cygrunsrv,nano
   SET PACKAGES=%PACKAGES%,gcc-core,make,automake,autoconf,readline,libncursesw-devel,libiconv,zlib-devel,gettext

   :: Do it!
   setup.exe -q -D -L -d -g -o -s %SITE% -l "%LOCALDIR%" -R "%ROOTDIR%" -C Base -P %PACKAGES% >nul

   setx PATH "%PATH%;/cygdrive/c/cygwin/bin;C:\cygwin\bin" /m

   ENDLOCAL

   C:
   chdir C:\cygwin\bin
   mkpasswd -cl > C:\cygwin\etc\passwd
   bash ssh-host-config -y
   cygrunsrv -S sshd


Verify if port 22 is in LISTEN

If you want to initialize or reset the catalog file, run this:

.. code-block:: bash

   arthur@heartofgold$ bb config --init /mnt/backup -v

.. important::
    This command preserves existing backups on the file system. It will eliminate only those archived or deleted.

   --destination, -d       Select the destination folder (root).
   --mode, -m              Select how rsync perform backup:

    * Full:
         Complete (full) backup.
    * Incremental:
         Incremental backup is based on the latest backup (the same files are linked with hard link).
         A Full backup is executed if this mode fails to find one.
    * Differential:
         Incremental backup is based on the latest Full backup (the same files are linked with hard link).
         A Full backup is executed if this mode fails to find one.
    * Mirror:
         Complete mirror backup. If a file in the source no longer exists, BB deletes it from the destination.
   --data, -D              Select the type of data to put under backup:
       The values change depending on the type of operating system:

       * **User** -> folder containing the home.
       * **Config** -> folder containing the configurations of the machine.
       * **Log** -> folder containing the log.
       * **Application** -> folder containing applications.
       * **System** -> the entire system starting from the root.
   --custom-data           Select the absolute paths to put under backup.
   --user, -u              Login name used to log into the remote host (being backed up)

        +-----------------------------+


.. _backup_computer:

Single backup
-------------

The backup of a single machine consists in taking the files and folders indicated in the command line,
and put them in the cataloging structure indicated above.

This is a few examples:

.. code-block:: bash

   arthur@heartofgold$ bb backup --computer host1 --destination /mnt/backup --data User Config --type MacOS
   # host1 SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_7.5
   # host1 SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_7.5
   Start backup on host1
   SUCCESS: Command rsync -ah --no-links arthur@host1:/Users :/private/etc /mnt/backup/host1/2018_08_08__10_28

.. important::

   Without specifying the "mode" flag, Butterfly Backup by default selects *Incremental* mode

.. code-block:: bash

   arthur@heartofgold$ bb backup --computer host1 --destination /mnt/backup --mode Full --data User Config --type MacOS --user root
   "root@host1's password:"
   Start backup on host1
   SUCCESS: Command rsync -ah --no-links root@host1:/Users :/private/etc /mnt/backup/host1/2018_08_08__10_30

.. code-block:: bash

.. note::
   If the backup destination is an MS-DOS fs, it will not support symlink creation. The message that will be returned is as follows:
   ``WARNING: MS-DOS file system doesn't support symlink file.``

.. _bulk_backup:

Bulk backup
-----------

Bulk backup follows the same logic and the same options as a single backup, but accepts a file containing the names or ips of the machine to be backed up.

This is a few examples:

.. code-block:: bash

   arthur@heartofgold$ bb backup --list /home/arthur/pclist.txt --destination /mnt/backup --data User Config --type MacOS
   # host1 SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_7.5
   # host1 SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_7.5
   ERROR: The port 22 on host2 is closed!
   ERROR: The port 22 on host3 is closed!
   Start backup on host1
   SUCCESS: Command rsync -ahu --no-links --link-dest=/mnt/backup/host1/2018_08_08__10_30 arthur@host1:/Users :/private/etc /mnt/backup/host1/2018_08_08__10_50


.. important::
   Port 22 (OpenSSH standard) is tested in order to verify the reachability of the machine. If the machine is not reachable, an error is generated:
   ``ERROR: The port 22 on host2 is closed!``

This example, is the same as the previous one, with the only difference being that the parallel flag is specified at 2.
This means that maximum two backup jobs will run at the same time. When a first process ends, another one is started.


.. code-block:: bash

   arthur@heartofgold$ bb backup --list /home/arthur/pclist.txt --destination /mnt/backup --data User Config --type MacOS --parallel 2 --log
   # host1 SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_7.5
   # host1 SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_7.5
   ERROR: The port 22 on host2 is closed!
   ERROR: The port 22 on host3 is closed!

This is the same example but specifying a retention at 3 (days). This means that in doing so we want to keep only 3 days backups.

Here we find the same example above but specifying a retention at 2 (days) and 5 backup copies. This means that at least 5 backup copies will be kept, even if they are older than two days.

.. important::
   If there is only one Full in our catalog, the retention policy will never delete that Full backup,
   but only Increments. We recommend doing more Full for better retention management.


.. _list:

####
List
####

When we run backup commands, a catalog is created. This serves both for future backups and all the restores that are made through Butterfly Backup.
To query this catalog, the list command exists.

.. code-block:: bash

   arthur@heartofgold$ bb list --help
   usage: bb list [-h] [--verbose] [--log] [--dry-run] --catalog CATALOG
                  [--backup-id ID | --archived | --cleaned | --computer HOSTNAME | --detail ID]
                  [--oneline]

   optional arguments:
     -h, --help            show this help message and exit
     --verbose, -v         Enable verbosity
     --log, -l             Create a log
     --dry-run, -N         Dry run mode

   List options:
     --catalog CATALOG, -C CATALOG
                           Folder where is catalog file
     --backup-id ID, -i ID
                           Backup-id of backup
     --archived, -a        List only archived backup
     --cleaned, -c         List only cleaned backup
     --computer HOSTNAME, -H HOSTNAME
                           List only match hostname or ip
     --detail ID, -d ID    List detail of file and folder of specific backup-id
     --oneline, -o         One line output


* **List options**
   --catalog, -C           Select the backups folder (root).
   --backup-id, -i         Select backup id in the catalog.
   --archived, -a          List only archived backups.
   --cleaned, -c           List only cleaned backups.
   --computer, -H          List only match hostname or ip.
   --detail, -d            List detail of file and folder of specific backup-id.
   --oneline, -o           One line and concise output.

First, let's query the catalog:

.. code-block:: bash

   arthur@heartofgold$ bb list --catalog /mnt/backup

   BUTTERFLY BACKUP CATALOG

   Backup id: aba860b0-9944-11e8-a93f-005056a664e0
   Hostname or ip: host1
   Timestamp: 2018-08-08 10:28:12

   Backup id: cc6e2744-9944-11e8-b82a-005056a664e0
   Hostname or ip: host1
   Timestamp: 2018-08-08 10:30:59

   Backup id: dd6de2f2-9a1e-11e8-82b0-005056a664e0
   Hostname or ip: host1
   Timestamp: 2018-08-08 10:58:59

Press ``q`` for exit. Then we select a backup-id:

.. code-block:: bash

   arthur@heartofgold$ bb list --catalog /mnt/backup --backup-id dd6de2f2-9a1e-11e8-82b0-005056a664e0
   Backup id: dd6de2f2-9a1e-11e8-82b0-005056a664e0
   Hostname or ip: host1
   Type: Incremental
   Timestamp: 2018-08-08 10:58:59
   Start: 2018-08-08 10:58:59
   Finish: 2018-08-08 11:02:49
   OS: MacOS
   ExitCode: 0
   Path: /mnt/backup/host1/2018_08_08__10_58
   List: backup.log
   etc
   Users

If you want to export the catalog list instead, include the log flag:

.. code-block:: bash

   arthur@heartofgold$ bb list --catalog /mnt/backup --log
   arthur@heartofgold$ cat /mnt/backup/backup.list

Instead if you want to see the details of your backup, add details flag:

.. code-block:: bash

   arthur@heartofgold$ bb list --catalog /mnt/backup --detail dd6de2f2-9a1e-11e8-82b0-005056a664e0

Now that we have identified a backup, let's proceed with the restore

.. _restore:

#######
Restore
#######

The restore process is the exact opposite of the backup process. It takes the files from a specific backup and push it to the destination computer.

   --type, -t              Type of operating system to put under backup:

       * **Unix** -> All UNIX os (Linux, BSD, Solaris).
       * **Windows** -> Windows Vista or higher with cygwin installed.
       * **MacOS** -> MacOSX 10.8 or higher.

   --timeout, -T           Specify number of seconds of I/O timeout.
   --mirror, -m            Mirror mode. If a file or folder not exist in destination, will delete it. Overwrite files.
   --skip-error, -e        Skip error. Quiet mode.

This is a few examples:

This command perform a restore on the same machine of the backup:

.. code-block:: bash

   arthur@heartofgold$ bb restore --catalog /mnt/backup --backup-id dd6de2f2-9a1e-11e8-82b0-005056a664e0 --computer host1 --log
   Want to do restore path /mnt/backup/host1/2018_08_08__10_58/etc? To continue [Y/N]? y

.. important::
   Without specifying the "type" flag that indicates the operating system on which the data are being retrieved,
   Butterfly Backup will select it directly from the catalog via the backup-id.

Now, select the last available backup on catalog; run this:

.. code-block:: bash

   arthur@heartofgold$ bb restore --catalog /mnt/backup --last --computer host1 --log
   Want to do restore path /mnt/backup/host1/2018_08_08__10_58/etc? To continue [Y/N]? y
   Want to do restore path /mnt/backup/host1/2018_08_08__10_58/Users? To continue [Y/N]? y
   SUCCESS: Command rsync -ahu -vP --log-file=/mnt/backup/host1/2018_08_08__10_58/restore.log /mnt/backup/host1/2018_08_08__10_58/etc arthur@host1:/restore_2018_08_08__10_59

The other, however, is zipped and deleted.

Lastly, let's look in the catalog and see that the backup was actually archived:

Donating is important.
If you do not want to do it to me, do it to some companies that do not speculate.
My main activity and the people of non-profit associations is to work for others, be they male or female, religious or non-religious, white or black or yellow or red, rich and poor.
The only real purpose is to serve the humanity of one's experience.
Below you will find some links to do it. **Thanks a lot**.
